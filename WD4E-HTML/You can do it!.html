<h5> She was tired of watching TV and she read all her books.</h5>
<h6>Suddenly, she found the vacuum cleaner in the cupboard.
<h7> Jessie saw that the living room was dusty and unclean.
<h8>"Mum," she shouted.
<h9>"I think I will vacuum the living room."
<h10>Jessie's mum ran into the living room and said, "Oh no! You're to young to vacuum the living room."</h10>
<h11>Jessie replied,"I'm ten years old and know how to do it."</h11>
<h12Mum was very worried but she decided to let Jessie give it a try.
<h13>After all,she was home and would keep an eye on her.</h13>
